-get intial repo setup
-use CRA to create basic typescript react app
-create POC for uploading images and storing them in indexedDB
-create POC for affine transformation based image alignment

-add better/more load indicators
-add validations to viewer processing 
-load any already processed images on viewer component load
-improve options for processing/re-processing images in viewer component

-store image natural dimensions in DB so they dont have to be re-calculated on the fly by loading image
-add check for viewer that adjustment image (image selected for adjustment) exists
-improve overall data/state validation and warning display
	-potentially modularize and make global
-add option on viewer component to process just entries with no aligned image (partial processing)

-improve touch behavior of mark image
	-try to prevent scrolling when marking image 
	-consider offsetting the magnification bubble on mobile 
	-add scroll area next to image on mobile to make it easier to get back to Mark buttons
-fix datetime recording (currently not local time) 
-fix video export option for hold last frame so that the value specified is actually used 
-develop touch compatible functionality for adjust crop component 

+test performance on various devices
	+explore options for improving image performance

+add functionality to abort 'export video locally' frame rendering loop
	--for example when the page changes or with a cancel button

+improve styles (layout and code)
	--implement bulma?

+fix typescript error for HTMLDialogElement
	--doesnt think show, showModal, or close methods exist

+modularize common db calls 

+make it so that boolean 'false' can be entered on the settings component
	--currently entering 'false' puts in literal 'false' string which is truthy

+refine/refactor export component (very messy currently)

+make duplicate feature of entry component also duplicate the alignedImage data 

+in entry component, improve handling of auto update of date
	--when re-ordered, decided how to handle (auto seek to new page?)
	--disable auto update and add save button? 

+ensure pagination on entry component can handle all cases with < 5 pages 

+update adjust component so that it warns if current chosenEntryIdForAdjustments value is invalid (not an existing entry id)

+fix jank when loading EntriesValidator component before validations finish and/or during transition from loading to finished

+ensure label elements are attached to the fields they label (aria)

+devise method to make hover image more magnified / controllable magnification 

+implement functionality to import/export raw db data 

+refine export/import progress reporting 

+further test component loading times with 300+ entries (seems too slow to load)
	+if slow loading cannot be fixed, add spinner indicator prior to page loading

+create live graph viewer with trends and stats

+onion skin image capture mode

+hamburger menu for entries list (maybe)
	--alteratively, refine the entries listings. more compact and adding a few options 

+create "disable/hide" entry option (so entry doesnt get exported or included in graphs)


----------------------------------------------------------------

long-term: 

suggestions from a redditor:
	+add unit toggle between imperial and metric
	+add height data field 
	+add some circumferences data fields 
	+add functionality to calculate bmi

+extract modal component and add 508 functionality such as focus trapping, virtual cursor traping, multiple exit methods, setting focus on open, and focus saving/reset on close
